And this is a table ma'am.  What in essence it consists of is a horizontal
rectilinear plane surface maintained by four vertical columnar supports,
which we call legs.  The tables in this laboratory, ma'am, are as advanced
in design as one will find anywhere in the world.

Let me do my TRIBUTE to FISHNET STOCKINGS ...

"And the next time you consider complaining that running Lucid Emacs
19.05 via NFS from a remote Linux machine in Paraguay doesn't seem to
get the background colors right, you'll know who to thank."
(By Matt Welsh)
Better living a beggar than buried an emperor.
Sinners can repent, but stupid is forever.
The sum of the Universe is zero.
Also, the Scots are said to have invented golf.  Then they had
to invent Scotch whiskey to take away the pain and frustration.
I am having FUN...  I wonder if it's NET FUN or GROSS FUN?
"It may be that our role on this planet is not to worship God but to
 create him."
 -Arthur C. Clarke
What do you have when you have six lawyers buried up to their necks in sand?
Not enough sand.
And... What in the world ever became of Sweet Jane?
	She's lost her sparkle, you see she isn't the same.
	Livin' on reds, vitamin C, and cocaine
	All a friend can say is "Ain't it a shame?"
		-- The Grateful Dead
